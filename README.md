## AI

An AI is a system that typically demonstrate at least some of the following behaviours associated with human intelligence: planning, learning, reasoning, problem solving, knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation and, to a lesser extent, social intelligence and creativity.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of AI. It is an approach to try achieve AI through systems that can find patterns in a set of data. “Machine learning can be described as the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed” - Stanford University.

## Deep Learning

One of the techniques for implementing machine learning.

## Data Science

Analyzing data, looking at data and then doing something with it, for usually some sort of business goal.

### Two main categories of machine learning.

- **Supervised learning**: Making predictions using data

  - Example: Is a given email “spam” or “ham”?
  - There is an outcome we are trying to predict

- **Unsupervised learning**
  - Example: Segment grocery store shoppers into clusters that exhibits similar behaviours
  - There is no “right answer"

More on

- **Supervised learning:**

  - Trying to predict a specific quantity
  - Having training example with labels
  - Can measure accuracy directly

- **Unsupervised learning**

  - Trying to “understand” the data
  - Looking for structure or unusual patterns
  - Not looking for something specific (supervised)
  - Does not require label data
  - Evaluation usually indirect or qualitative

## How does machine learning work?

At very high-level here, are the two main steps of supervised learning.

- First, train a machine learning model using labeled data
  - “Labeled data” has been labeled with outcome.
  - “Machine learning model” learns the relationship between the attributes of the data and its outcome.
- Then, make predictions on new data for which label is unknown.

> The primary goal of supervised learning is to build a model that “generalizes”: It accurately predicts the future rather than the past!
